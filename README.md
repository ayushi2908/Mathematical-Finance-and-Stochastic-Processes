# Mathematical-Finance-and-Stochastic-Processes
This is the project to learn the topics in portfolio management.
The assignment problem is as follows.
Pick three companies of your choice (each from a different sector). Plot the Markowitz efficient frontier of a portfolio of the chosen three stocks. Use one year of historical data for the calculations.

I have chosen the stocks of Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy and Tata Steel. The CSV files of one year of historical data are added to the repository. The Python code for plotting the Markowitz efficient frontier is added to the repository. 
Calculated the expected return, expected volatility and Sharpe ratio (i.e., return/volatility) for different weights of the three stocks in the portfolio.
Plotted return v/s volatility using matplotlib. This plot shows the "efficient" parts of the risk-return spectrum.
